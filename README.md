# Sports-Analytics

I will be uploading IPython notebooks with projects concerning sports analytics. I would love suggestions on how I could make the code more concise and efficient. I will mainly be looking to explore baseball and basketball data but open to different project ideas. Feel free to provide any feedback and enjoy exploring!
